# Anyhoo packages

## Introduction

A collection of Dart/Flutter packages that will be helpful for creating new Flutter apps.
It also contains some usefil tools

I decided to use this instead of copy and pasting code to new apps. It should also help 
in not having to back port code when updating in one app.
