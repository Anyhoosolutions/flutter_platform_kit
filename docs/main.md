# Anyhoo packages

## Introduction

A collection of Dart/Flutter packages that will be helpful for creating new Flutter apps.

I decided to use this instead of copy and pasting code to new apps. It should also help 
in not having to back port code when updating in one app.


## Packages

## anyhoo_core

Contains some model classes that are used in multiple packages, such as an abstract `User` class.

## anyhoo_firebase

## anyhoo_router

## anyhoo_image_selector
